# Microbial fuel cells: microbial diversity analysis

## Overview
Study analyzing 227 samples from 30 MFC experiments using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing to understand microbial community composition, functional pathways, and performance in wastewater treatment and bioenergy generation.

## Key findings
- Dominant phyla: Pseudomonadota (13.45%), Bacteroidota (9.88%) overal
- Key electroactive genera: Geobacter (1.10%), Proteiniphilum (0.84%) overall
- Exclusive specialized metabolic pathways in different effluent conditions
- Complex microbial interactions in bioelectrochemical systems
  
## Limitations
- Sequencing depth:

## Notes
- Taxonomic classification files are divided in:
  * Initial: Silva classifier (ss files), not published
  * Final: Greengenes2 2024.09 classifier (gg files)
